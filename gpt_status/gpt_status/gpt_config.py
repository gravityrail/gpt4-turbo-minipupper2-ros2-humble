# Description:
# Defines a GPTConfig class to hold various configurations related to GPT, AWS, and audio recording.
# Sets default values for GPT parameters such as model, API key, temperature, max tokens, and penalties.
# Defines system and user prompts, assistant response, and chat history as default configurations.
# Includes AWS IAM, S3, Transcribe, and Polly related configurations.
# Defines audio recording related configurations such as duration, sample rate, and volume gain multiplier.
